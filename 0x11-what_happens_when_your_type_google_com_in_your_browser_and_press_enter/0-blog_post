What Happens when you type in google.com in your browser and press enter.

Have you ever wondered what happens when you type "google.com" into your browser and press Enter? We all use the internet on a daily basis, but many of us don't really know what goes on behind the scenes when we interact with websites. In this blog post, we'll take a closer look at what happens when you type "google.com" in your browser and press Enter.

First, let's talk about what happens when you type "google.com". "google.com" is a domain name, which is a human-readable address that we use to access websites on the internet. However, computers communicate with each other using IP addresses, which are numerical addresses. So, when you type "google.com" into your browser, your computer needs to translate that domain name into an IP address that it can use to communicate with the Google server.

To do this, your computer sends a request to a Domain Name System (DNS) server, which is like a phonebook for the internet. The DNS server looks up the IP address associated with "google.com" and sends it back to your computer. Your computer then uses that IP address to connect to the Google server.

Once your computer is connected to the Google server, it sends a request for the homepage of the Google website. The Google server receives this request and responds by sending the homepage's HTML code back to your computer.

Now, your web browser comes into play. The browser interprets the HTML code and renders it as the Google homepage that you see on your screen. This includes displaying text, images, and other media that make up the page. Your browser may also make additional requests for images, scripts, and other resources needed to fully render the webpage.

At this point, you can interact with the Google homepage. You can search for information, access various Google services, and navigate to other pages within the site. All of this happens through a series of requests and responses between your computer and the Google server.

In conclusion, when you type "google.com" into your browser and press Enter, your computer communicates with a DNS server to translate the domain name into an IP address. Your computer then connects to the Google server and requests the homepage of the Google website. The server responds by sending the HTML code for the page, which your browser interprets and renders as the Google homepage that you see on your screen. From there, you can interact with the site and access various Google services. It's a complex process, but it all happens in the blink of an eye, allowing us to access the wealth of information available on the internet.

Q: What happens when you type google.com in your browser?

Upon typing in "google.com" and pressing Enter, the browser takes a number of steps which can be outlined as:

Resolve IP address of the URL via DNS
Generate an HTTP request with headers (accept, user-agent, cookie, etc)
Open an HTTP connection to the resolved IP address
Send the request to the server
Receive the response from the server
Parse response headers
Depending on the response headers, perform additional operations
Decompress the response body if it's compressed (e.g. gzipped)
Parse the HTML code inside the response body
Resolve any additional resources (images, stylesheets, scripts, etc)
Start loading those resources via their URLs using the same steps
Render the HTML as soon as required resources are loaded, continue loading remaining resources in background
When all the resources are loaded, close the HTTP connection
Q: What are "additional operations" that a browser can perform depending on response headers?

For example, it can redirect to a different resource on a 301/302/303/307 status code and a location header.

Browsers also respect policies regulated by the server, e.g. cache-control header which instructs how the resources can be cached.

Response headers may also contain information regarding the response content, including its type, length, and encoding, which may be used by the browser to properly display the content.

Q: What is DNS?

DNS, which stands for Domain Name System, is essentially a dictionary that maps URLs of Internet resources to their corresponding IP addresses. Most people call it "the phonebook of the Internet".

In most cases, the IP of the first outbound DNS server is provided by the ISP, which can be configured on a per-router or per-machine basis. It's also possible to use any other DNS server by setting the corresponding IP address in system's settings.

Any individual DNS server may route a query to a different DNS server if it doesn't have the requested DNS record.

Browsers and operating systems have their own local DNS cache which helps avoid querying DNS servers every time.

Q: How are DNS records kept up to date?

When setting up a domain, the owner configures it by specifying name servers given by their hosting provider. These changes reflect slowly because once the records change on the name server, an adjacent DNS server may still use its older cached records for some time.

Since a request from a user's device to a remote server usually takes multiple hops through different DNS servers each with their own local cache, it may take up to 72 hours before the correct IP address is fully propagated.

The process of updating DNS records on changes is called "DNS propagation".

Q: What is a web server?

Web server is a piece of software that handles HTTP requests, e.g. IIS, nginx, Apache, Kestrel, etc. It receives an incoming request from a client (e.g. browser), routes it to a specific handler based on request parameters (i.e. URL, headers, content), processes it, and then returns a response.
